I am a PhD student in [Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) at Johns Hopkins University, working with Professor [Nicolas Loizou](https://nicolasloizou.github.io/). I am primarily interested in Stochastic Optimization (Optimization Algorithms, Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra), Machine Learning, Algorithmic Game Theory and Distributed & Federated Learning.

I have a BSc. in [Statistics](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/stat) and a MSc. in [Computer Science](http://grad.cs.aueb.gr/en/index.php) from the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB). Before starting my PhD I was also a student researcher in the Machine Learning and Optimization Lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)), working on learned optimization and federated learning.
